Create a FastAPI REST API for a Todo List Manager with the following features:

1. CRUD Operations:
   - Create new todo items with title, description, priority (low/medium/high), and due date
   - Read all todos with filtering by status and priority
   - Update existing todos
   - Delete completed todos

2. Data Model:
   - Todo items should have: id, title, description, status (pending/in_progress/completed), priority, due_date, created_at, updated_at
   - Use SQLite database with SQLAlchemy ORM

3. API Endpoints:
   - POST /todos - Create new todo
   - GET /todos - List all todos with optional query params for filtering
   - GET /todos/{id} - Get specific todo
   - PUT /todos/{id} - Update todo
   - DELETE /todos/{id} - Delete todo
   - GET /todos/stats - Get statistics (total, completed, pending)

4. Requirements:
   - Input validation using Pydantic models
   - Proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
   - Rate limiting (max 100 requests per minute)
   - API documentation with Swagger UI
   - Logging for all operations
   - CORS enabled for frontend integration

5. Quality Standards:
   - Type hints throughout
   - Comprehensive pytest test cases with >80% coverage
   - Docker deployment configuration
   - Environment variable configuration for database path
